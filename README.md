# php-bootstrap

A simple starting point for any php project. Provides you with:

- [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) compatible class loader (using Symfony's `UniversalClassLoader`).
- Bootstrap file where you can begin writing your app.
- .htaccess with mod_rewrite rule which routes all requests to your bootstrap file.
- Skeleton folder structure for your own code, 3rd party libraries and tests.
